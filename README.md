# Subpixel-Counting-Based-Diameter-Measurement
Sub-Pixel counting based diameter measurement algorithm for industrial Machine vision
In terms of usage, the background should be filled in with white and the part of interest should be black, then the algorithm should be run. The preprocessing step is included in the subpixel_counting_method function. You can activate or deactivate it from there.

But I recommend you apply a preprocessing step to eliminate undesired noises.
